      question: "Can I transfer my ZoneBook credits to another user?",

They are linked to your registered account and cannot be shared, gifted, or transferred to another user. However, ZoneBook offers referral rewards, where both you and your referred friend can earn bonus credits. If you're looking to help someone else, you can use your credits to purchase services on their behalf.

      question: "Do ZoneBook credits have an expiration date?",

Promotional or bonus credits usually have a shorter validity period, whereas purchased credits may have a longer duration. You can check the expiry date of your credits in the 'Credits' section of your dashboard. Expired credits cannot be restored, so it’s best to use them before they expire. ZoneBook may send reminders about expiring credits via email or notifications to help you utilize them effectively before they become invalid."

      question: "What happens if my payment fails while purchasing credits?",

If the amount was deducted but credits were not added to your account, contact ZoneBook support with your transaction details. Most failed transactions are automatically refunded within a few working days. Ensure that your payment method has sufficient balance and is correctly linked to avoid transaction failures in the future."

Refund eligibility depends on the terms and conditions at the time of purchase. Promotional and bonus credits are strictly non-refundable. If you're unable to use your credits, consider redeeming them for available services before they expire. In some cases, credits may be converted to vouchers or discounts instead of direct refunds."

Always check the specific terms of your credits before making a purchase to optimize their usage."
